 1#onPress = { () => props.navigation.navigate('MealDetailsScreen') }
 navigate between screens
 2#onPress = { () => props.navigation.push('MealDetailsScreen') }
 Same as 2# but the exception is shows animation if we go again and again 
 to the current screen.
 3#onPress = { ()=> props.navigation.goBack () }
 We can use this if we want to go back to the previous page after performing an
 action like save, update etc.
 4#onPress={()=> props.navigation.replace('CategorieMealsScreen')}
 Replace the current  screen with the given one and makes empty the whole
 stack for that reason the backbutton disappeared and user can't go back. We can use
 this feature for logout page.
 #We need to use "useLayoutEffect" hook and props.navigation.setOptions to update the
 "options" prop of a screen.
